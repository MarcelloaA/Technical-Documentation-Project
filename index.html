        <header>Introduction</header>
        <p>Transaction Services is a subset of corporate finance and focuses on the due diligence of Target businesses.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of due diligence:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Financial due diligence (buy-side); and</li>
          <li>Vendor due diligence (sell-side).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This documentation aims to discuss the differences between the main types of due diligence, the valuation techniques and how they differ depending on the acquirer and nature of the Target business, and the main technical areas.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Financial_due_diligence">
        <header>Financial Due Diligence</header>
        <p>This is the main type of work completed and relates to buy-side deals. A buy-side deal is one where the TS advisers are acting for the buyer who are aiming to purchase the Target. Clients are typically PE houses who are looking to add to their portfolio.</p>
        <p>TS work for FDD typically commences towards the tail-end of the acquisition life cycle and will be one of the final professional services type work (alongside LDD, TDD, ITDD and CDD).</p>
        <p>The value add proposition when it comes to FDD relates to the adjustments made to the valuation (discussed later in the valuation techniques section) which will provide the PE house with a third party opinion when they come to negotiate a final purchase price with the Target.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Vendor_due_diligence">
        <header>Vendor due diligence</header>
        <p>This work is more niche, as such it is less frequent than FDD, and relates to sell-side deals. A sell-side deal is one where the TS advisers act directly for a Target who is in the process of selling their business. Clients vary across several sectors and sizes.</p>
        <p>TS work for VDD commences earlier on in the selling process, in comparison to FDD, with the TS team working directly alongside the Target's M&A advisers to achieve the most optimum outcome for the client - whilst working objectively</p>
        <p>The value add proposition for VDD comes from involving TS advisers early on who have sufficient time to assess the viability of the Target and its financials. Moreover, it allows the M&A team to understand how negotiations with regards to the valuation will go with potential acquirers. It may also speed up the process as some acquirers will not see the need to undertake a full due diligence exercise given one has already been completed.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Valuation_Techniques">
        <header>Valuation Techniques</header>
        <p>The valuation technique differs depending on the type of business being acquired and the purpose of acquisition however, these are the typical techniques used:</p>
        <h4>EV/EBITDA</h4>
        <p>This valuation technique is the most commonly used and is popular amongst PE houses. It's popularity derives from the fact that it uses EBITDA as a proxy which reduces the risk of any clever accounting tricks being used to manipulate the profit figure. A downside however, is that the multiple will be based on a proxy of a "comparable" company - which will never be entirely accurate.</p>
        <p>The formula for this valuation is in several parts:</p>
        <div class="explanation">
          <ol>
            <li>Calculate EBITDA by making the required adjustments to net profit;</li>
            <li>Analyse comparable companies that have recently been sold and ascertain a EV multiple; and</li>
            <li><code>Multiply the adjusted EBITDA figure by the proxy multiple to arrive at the EV figure (pre adjustments).</code></li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <h4>Revenue Multiplier</h4>
        <p>This valuation technique is not frequently used however, may be a more sensible solution where the Target is making losses (negative EBITDA) or where its business model significantly relies on recurring revenues</p>
        <p>The steps to calculate this method are as follows:</p>
        <div class="explanation">
          <ol>
            <li>Ascertain a recurring revenue run-rate figure;</li>
            <li>Analyse comparable companies that have recently been sold and ascertain a revenue multiplier figure; and</li>
            <li><code>Multiply the run-rate recurring reveunue figure by the multiple.</code></li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Technical_Areas">
        <header>Technical Areas</header>
        <p>The technical areas for TS advisers mainly relate to the work which impacts the negotiations on the final purchase price.</p>
        <p>The three main technical areas are:</p>
        <h4 class="technical_areas_category">1. Quality of Earnings</h4>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p>This relates to adjustments made to <code>EBITDA</code> to arrive at an adjusted <code>EBITDA</code> figure which should reflect the true earnings figure for the Target.</p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="technical_areas_category">2. Net debt</h4>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p>This relates to adjustments made to the <code>Net debt</code> position of the Target to reflect the balance sheet on a <code>cash free and debt free basis</code>.</p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="technical_areas_category">3. Net working capital</h4>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p>This relates to the <code>cash flows</code> required to keep the Target's operations afloat. These adjustments should result in a normalised NWC figure which should reflect the typical cash flow seasonality profile.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="P&L_focus">
        <header>P&L Focus</header>
        <p>The main risk points on the P&L relate to revenue drivers, gross margin trends and overheads required to maintain / grow future operations.</p>
        <p>Based on the above risks, TS advisers will analyse each revenue driver in turn and analyse its gross margin profile. This will allow them to understand whether this revenue stream is in fact a worthwhile pursuit and allows them to understand the reasons behind any margin movements.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Balance_sheet_focus">
        <header>Balance Sheet Focus</header>
        <p>As there are many elements on a businesses balance sheet, each business will have different "high risk" areas based on their operations and the industry they operate in.</p>
        <p>The TS advisers will analyse each line item in turn to understand what individual items make up these balances. They will likely have further questions to discuss with the Target's Management team in order to ascertain whether any NWC or net debt adjustments need to be made.</p>
